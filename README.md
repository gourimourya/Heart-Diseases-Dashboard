❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

🎯 Objective / Goal:
To analyze patient health data and identify key indicators that influence the risk of heart disease. The goal is to support healthcare decision-makers by providing actionable insights into patient trends, risk factors, and disease prediction.

🛠️ Tools Used:

Power BI (for visualization and dashboarding)
Power Query (for data cleaning and transformation)
DAX (for calculated measures)
Excel / CSV (as data source)

📌 Important KPIs:

💔 Heart Disease Rate (%)
👨‍⚕️ Total Patients Count
🧓 Average Age of Patients
🫀 Average Cholesterol & Max Heart Rate
⚠️ High-Risk Age Groups

🔍 Key Insights:
🔴 Around 54% of patients are diagnosed with heart disease.
👵 Patients aged 50–60 show highest heart disease risk.
🚹 Males have more heart disease cases than females.
💉 High cholesterol and low max heart rate are strong risk indicators.
💔 Exercise-induced angina is frequently observed in patients with heart disease.

📉 Chest pain type "ASY" (asymptomatic) has the highest risk association.
🔬 Patients with abnormal ST Slope or Resting ECG are at higher risk.
🧪 High fasting blood sugar shows mild correlation with heart risk.

Responsibilities:

Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query.
Used DAX for custom KPIs and calculated columns.
Created visualizations to detect patterns between health indicators and disease.
Enabled slicers for dynamic filtering by age, gender, and other attributes.

Provided insights to identify high-risk groups based on clinical features.
